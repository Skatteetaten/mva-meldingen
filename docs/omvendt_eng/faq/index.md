For those who do not have an ERP, or if the ERP is not suited to deliver the VAT return for reverse tax liability, the Tax administration has a web-based portal for submitting VAT return for reverse tax liability. Altinn will still be used for identification and information exchange.

### Has a draft been made visually of what the new report should look like in the ERP?

The tax authorities do not set requirements for what the report should look like in the accounting system. The goal is for users to keep accounts as normal, and for the system to compile the information from the accounts to the VAT return for reverse tax liability, so that the user can submit the return.
The new reporting is code-based and will facilitate digital collaboration. Numbered fields are replaced by a dynamic list of specification lines. It is also possible to provide comments both for the entire report and per line.

### What authentication methods will be used for the VAT return for reverse tax liability submissions?

Authentication is carried out with personal login in ID-porten for both system-to-system and portal submissions, not by password and username. ERPs must offer ID-porten login window for their users, so they can log in using electronic ID from ID-porten. To avoid unnecessary logins user will stay logged in for 8 hours.
