For VAT returns for reverse tax liability there are quarterly terms, anf the first deadline will be May 10th 2023. Reports and corrections for terms up till and including December 31st 2022 must be submitted in the old format as before.

### How will the new VAT return for reverse tax liability be submitted?

Businesses and advisors are encouraged to deliver directly from their ERP. The Tax Administration is working with ERP-suppliers to enable this. For those who do not have an ERP, or if the ERP is not suited to deliver the VAT return for reverse tax liability, the Tax administration is developing a web-based portal for submitting VAT return for reverse tax liability. Altinn will still be used for identification and information exchange.

### Has a draft been made visually of what the new report should look like in the ERP?

The tax authorities do not set requirements for what the report should look like in the accounting system. The goal is for users to keep accounts as normal, and for the system to compile the information from the accounts to the VAT return for reverse tax liability, so that the user can submit the return.
The new reporting will be code-based and will facilitate digital collaboration. Today's numbered fields will be replaced by a dynamic list of specification lines. It will also be possible to provide comments both for the entire report and per line. The code list for the VAT return for reverse tax liability is available on [Github](https://skatteetaten.github.io/mva-meldingen/omvendt_eng/informasjonsmodell/#encoding).

### Is it possible to attach files with documentation in the new VAT return for reverse tax liability?

Yes, it is possible to attach up to 50 files, and the files can be up to 25mb per file.
We will support the following file formats:

    - PDF
    - Open Office XML (OOXML)
    - Open Document Format (ODF)
    - JPG eller PNG

### What authentication methods will be used for the VAT return for reverse tax liability submissions?

Authentication will be carried out with personal login in ID-porten for both system-to-system and portal submissions, not by password and username like today. ERPs must offer ID-porten login window for their users, so they can log in using electronic ID from ID-porten. To avoid unnecessary logins user will stay logged in for 8 hours.

We want to offer Maskinporten support for system-to-system submissions and we are currently looking into the legal and practical issues concerning Maskinporten. If Maskinporten is offered, it will be later than January 1st 2023. ID-porten will be used until further notice.

### Will there be a code list of descriptions for the various codes?

This can be found on [Github](https://skatteetaten.github.io/mva-meldingen/omvendt_eng/informasjonsmodell/#encoding).
