# Implementation guide for system-to-system submission of VAT-report

## Background
The MEMO-project is developing a new tax return for VAT compensation (VAT return). The goal of the MEMO-project is to achieve increased compliance, equal competitive conditions, simplification for reporting businesses, and a more effective administration of the VAT system.
Some simplification is a result of changes in the VAT return; fever sources of errors, easier returns, and making it easier to fulfil the duty to provide information.
A new VAT return will also provide new opportunities for guidance and dialog through validation before submission, and reminders for tasks. In addition, it will be possible to offer an increased degree of access to information to achieve effectiveness and safety through digital reconciliation of the VAT return. There is also a desire for better interaction between accounting/ERP systems and Altinn/Tax Authority systems, for example automatic receipt for submitted VAT returns.

## What's new

-	An end-user system creates a VAT return through a user interface.
-	The end-user system can execute operations on VAT returns through an API between the system and Altinn 3. These API's are new, and not the same as the ones currently being used in Altinn 2.
-	API's for validation, signing and submitting VAT returns will be available
-	Existing functionality in Altinn 2, such as inbox, roles and rights will also be available in the new service.
-	Reporting business, accountants and advisors can access submitted information, sign VAT returns and submit returns to the tax authority.
-	The tax authority will offer a portal solution where taxable persons can access submitted information, make changes and submit VAT returns.
-	Login and authentication of the end user or system is carried out using ID-porten or Maskinporten.
