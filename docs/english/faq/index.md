## General

### Which changes are coming in the modernisation of the VAT-domain? 

##### New registration solution for the Value Added Tax Register.
The Tax Administration has launched a new registration solution for the Value Added Tax Register. With the new service, processing time for most registration cases will be reduced from weeks to minutes. [Link to the service](https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/business-and-organisation/vat-and-duties/vat/register/).

##### New VAT-return.
The goal of the project is to achieve increased compliance, equal competitive conditions, simplification for reporting businesses, and a more effective administration of the VAT system. The new VAT-return will be launched on 1 January 2022. 

##### New sales and purchases report.
A proposition for a new solution for reporting on sales and purchases is currently being considered by the Ministry of Finance. The proposed solution will help both businesses and the Tax Administration to ensure equal treatment and prevent unlawful distortion of competition for businesses.  The proposition will demand changes in laws and regulations, and has yet to be released for the mandatory public consultation. 

### Will there be a transition period from the old to the new services?
For the registration solution, the transition lasted for two weeks, until march 1st 2021 for new registrations. Coordinated Register Notification part 2 will be available for changing or deleting an application until the second quarter of 2021.
For the VAT-return, no transition period is planned.

### Will there be an "emergency" solution in case of technical difficulties?
For the registration solution, it will be possible to submit an incomplete application after the first stages of the service. 
For the VAT-return it will be possible to file and submit the VAT-return in the online portal. 
 

## Registration solution

### Who can fill out an application for registration, and who can submit? 
  
To fill out and submit VAT-returns, Altinn-roles are needed. 
The business itself can fill out the VAT-return, or someone with the Altinn role Auditor in charge/Ansvarlig revisor, Accounting employee/Regnskapsmedarbeider, Accountant without signing rights/Regnskapsfører uten signeringsrettighet or Assistant auditor/Revisormedarbeider. 
If you are going to sign on behalf of others, you must have the Altinn role “Limited signing rights/Begrenset signeringsrettighet", alternatively "Contact person NUF/Kontaktperson NUF”, if you are registering a Norwegian registered foreign enterprise (NUF). 

### Why has the Tax Administration chosen to limit filling out registrations or VAT-returns by using Altinn-roles?
  
Until now, there has been no limit to who can fill out returns for a business, and if the business has poor routines for signing, unintended returns can be submittet and give serious consequences. The new use of roles is safer, and in line with all other modernised services in the Tax Administration.  

### Can legal councel assist businesses in their VAT-registration?
  
Legal councel and other advisors can ask the business to delegate access to "Merverdiavgift Registreringstjeneste" in Altinn. Alternatively the legal councel can request access from the business, if a prior relationship exists. Access can be given to a person or another business (only businesses with a prior relationship with the reporting business in Altinn). Legal councel who wants personal access can submit either their personal identity number or their Altinn-username, as identification for the reporting business.  Access is not time-limited, so the reporting business should remove the access if the legal councel or advisor no longer needs access. 

It is also possible for legal councel to acquire Altinn-roles in reporting businesses. This must be done in co-operation with the business in question. The role title will only be visible for the one who delegates, and not in other systems, such as the Register of Legal Entities.

The Tax Administration have plans to develop functionality for delegating power of attorney in individual cases where there is need to delegate to a proxy. There can be a need for this in different cases, such as application, complaints and control. This is additional functionality which will be developed at a later time. 
 
 
 
## VAT-return

### When will the new VAT-return be launched?

The new VAT-return will be launched on January 1st 2022. This means that you must submit VAT-returns for periods after January 1st 2022 in the new format, according to the deadlines in your VAT term. 

### How will the new VAT-return be submitted?
Businesses and advisors are encouraged to deliver directly from their ERP. The Tax Administration is working with ERP-suppliers to enable this. For those who do not have an ERP, or if the ERP is not suited to deliver VAT-returns, the Tax administration is developing a portal for submitting VAT-returns. Altinn will still be used for identification and information exchange.


### At what aggregation level will amounts be entered in the new VAT-return? 

Same level as before. For more information regarding the suggested reporting on transaction levels, see "Sales and purchase report".

## Sales and purchase report

### What does the sales and purchase report entail, and when will it be launched?

The sales and purchase report is still in the proposal stage, and is currently being reviewed by the Ministry of Finance. When the suggestion is released for mandatory public consultation the desired launch date will be set. The need for time to develop the sales and purchase report for businesses, ERPs and the Tax Administration will be taken into account. The proposal includes a reporting duty for sales and purchase transactions for private and public organisations. The reporting duty will apply for single transactions, and include information regarding invoice number, documentation date, name of parties in the transaction, organisational number and information on VAT and remuneration. 
The new reporting duty will make it possible to see transactions in context, which is not possible today. There will be no requirement to report information on the purpose of the transaction. A large number of businesses are using ERPs with requirements to provide accounting information in standardised formats (SAF-T). This enables direct reporting from the ERP to the tax administration. 
The purpose of the new reporting duty is to increase compliance, help both businesses and the Tax Administration to ensure equal treatment and prevent unlawful distortion of competition for businesses. An important goal is to limit extra work for businesses, by offering reporting directly from ERPs.

### Will the new reporting duty apply to all businesses, or will there be exceptions for small businesses? 

The proposal opens for exceptions in some cases. 

## Test
