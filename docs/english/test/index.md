The information on this page is for ERP-providers that have made arrangments with the Norwegian Tax Administration to participate in testing the new verison of the VAT-report. If you wish to participate please contact us by e-mail mva-modernisering@skatteetaten.no. We will provide you with a test-user, as well as technical support if needed. We are currently on 'Test 3'. For a complete test plan, see further down the page. Test documentation for test 3 consists of

- Description of api - <a href="https://skatteetaten.github.io/mva-meldingen/english/api/" target="_blank">Api</a>

- Validation rules that are part of the test - see further down on this page
- Examples of test cases - see further down this page
  In addition, there is a need for a test user. This is distributed directly to participating ERPs.

# Test plan

## Content of the test

The ERP-system must do the following:

1. Log into ID-porten to obtain a session (and token).
2. Develop an application/ client that should
   - Send a request to Skatteetaten validation service in order to validate a vat tax return
   - Create an instance in the Altinn3 app
   - Upload 1 MvaMeldingInnsending
   - Upload 1 MvaMelding
   - Upload 0 or more attachements
   - Submit MvaMeldingInnsending

Skatteetaten have made available a test application that shows how the steps described above can be done. This is written in [jupyter notebook format](https://jupyter.org/):

1. [Jupyter notebook demo for retrieving, validation](https://github.com/Skatteetaten/mva-meldingen/blob/master/docs/documentation/test/demo.ipynb). Download the folder test and run the script demo.ipynb (the script will execute all steps in the process: call ping service to check the connection and validate the mva tax return.
2. [Jupyter notebook demo for retrieving, validation and submitting](https://github.com/Skatteetaten/mva-meldingen/blob/master/docs/documentation/test/innsending-eksempel.ipynb). Run the script demo.ipynb. The script will execute all steps in the process.
3. [Pyton script to fetch token](https://github.com/Skatteetaten/mva-meldingen/blob/master/docs/documentation/test/Steg/log_in_idporten.py) and [postman script to validate mva tax return](https://github.com/Skatteetaten/mva-meldingen/blob/master/docs/documentation/test/MeldingValidering.postman_collection.json). First step is to log in to ID-porten (described later), and store the token in the format `Bearer <token-here>` as an environment variable by the name "test-bearer" in postman, then use the postman script in order to validate the mva vat return.
4. [Example XML files](https://github.com/Skatteetaten/mva-meldingen/tree/master/docs/documentation/test/eksempler/melding)

## Start using ID-porten

When starting testing it is possible to use the Norwegian Tax Administration ID-porten integration , however we recommend setting up your own integration, as the process is partially manual, and when using the service in production each user must have their own integration. Another advantage of starting the integration process early is that the integration can be tested in the test environment. ID-porten is owned by the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency (Digdir) and details on how to start using ID-porten is provided here: <a href="https://samarbeid.digdir.no/id-porten/id-porten/18" target="_blank">ID-Porten documentation</a>. When ordering access, please provide information that you would like to access the skattemeldings-API from Skatteetaten.

A customer relationship with DigDir provides access to their self-service solution, which in turn provides access to the administration of the customer's use of ID-Porten. In the self-service solution, the customer can generate a so-called client_id and define a callback url:

- client_id: is an automatically generated unique identifier for the service.
- callback url: The Uri that the client is allowed to go to after logging in. After a successful login in ID-Porten, this url will be called.
  If it takes too long to establish a customer relationship with DigDir, the end-user systems can use Skatteetaten's client_id in the meantime. For this test, Skatteetaten has created the following client_id that can be used by the end-user systems:

      - `client_id: 23cc2587-ea4e-4a5f-aa5c-dfce3d6c5f09`
      	  - Callback URL for this client_id is set to  http://localhost:12345/token  (If there are consumers who want other callback URLs it can be provided)

## Login with ID-porten

ID-porten login can be implemented in all types of end-user systems

- Desktop applications
- Web applications

Under the condition that the application can open a URL in a web browser, where login is carried out, and also has to be able run a web-server receiving a web-request (in the form of a redirect from ID-porten after login) on the callback-url.

The client must do the following REST call towards ID-porten:

- Launch the system browser and make authorization calls against ID-porten. Read more about it here: <a href="https://difi.github.io/felleslosninger/oidc_protocol_authorize.html" target="_blank">https://difi.github.io/felleslosninger/oidc_protocol_authorize.html</a>
- The user is then sent to ID-porten for login. Existing test users for testing towards Skatteetaten's services today can be used.
- Set up a web server waiting for callback from the browser. After successful login ID-Porten is sent used to this web server. This web server must be set to listen to callback URLs http://localhost:12345/token (as according to previous section).
- Make a token request. Read more about it here: <a href="https://difi.github.io/felleslosninger/oidc_protocol_token.html" target="_blank">https://difi.github.io/felleslosninger/oidc_protocol_token.html</a>

The following test environment at ID-porten is used:

- /authorize endpoint: `https://oidc-ver2.difi.no/idporten-oidc-provider/authorize`
- /token endpoint: `https://oidc-ver2.difi.no/idporten-oidc-provider/token`

For details on which HTTP parameters must be sent in the call, see the file [log_in_idporten.py](https://github.com/Skatteetaten/mva-meldingen/blob/master/docs/documentation/test/Steg/log_in_idporten.py)

## Call the vat tax return API

After login and and token request you will have an ID-porten access-token. This token is used as a bearer token in a HTTP-call on the validation service, and must be exchanged for an Altinn-token, which is used as a bearer token in the HTTP-calls in the filing process on the Tax Administrations Altinn3-API for VAT tax return filing. For details, see <a href="https://skatteetaten.github.io/mva-meldingen/english/api/" target="_blank">Api</a>.
